        <p>Olympic Weightlifting is one of the most effective training methods in the world for developing power, speed, coordination, mobility, and full-body strength. At FSC Durban, our Olympic Weightlifting programme is professionally coached, technique-driven, and designed for athletes and everyday people alike — whether you want to compete, get stronger, or improve your performance in sport and life.</p>

        <h2>What Is Olympic Weightlifting?</h2>

        <p>Olympic Weightlifting is a strength sport and training methodology centred around two main lifts:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Snatch</li>
          <li>The Clean &amp; Jerk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These lifts require you to move heavy weights from the ground to overhead in one or two explosive movements. Unlike traditional gym training, Olympic Weightlifting focuses on speed and strength combined, technical precision, full-body coordination, and mobility and stability.</p>

        <p>This makes it one of the most effective ways to build functional, athletic strength that carries over into nearly every sport and physical activity.</p>
