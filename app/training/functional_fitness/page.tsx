          <h2>What Is Functional Fitness?</h2>

          <p>Functional Fitness is a training approach based on natural human movement patterns such as:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Squatting</li>
            <li>Hinging</li>
            <li>Pushing and pulling</li>
            <li>Carrying and lifting</li>
            <li>Rotating and stabilising</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These movements mirror everyday actions like picking things up, carrying groceries, climbing stairs, or playing with your children. Functional Fitness improves your ability to perform these tasks with strength, efficiency, and reduced risk of injury.</p>
