        <h1>Calisthenics Training in Durban | FSC Durban</h1>

        <p><strong>Build strength, control, mobility, and body awareness using your own bodyweight with Calisthenics training at FSC Durban.</strong></p>

        <p>Calisthenics is a highly effective training method that develops strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination through controlled bodyweight movements. At FSC Durban, our Calisthenics programme is professionally coached, progressive, and suitable for all levels — from complete beginners to advanced athletes.</p>

        <p>If you're looking for <strong>Calisthenics classes in Durban</strong> or a gym that offers structured bodyweight training, FSC Durban provides expert coaching and a supportive environment to help you master your own body and move with strength and confidence.</p>

        <h2>What Is Calisthenics?</h2>

        <p>Calisthenics is a form of strength training that uses your own bodyweight as resistance. Movements include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pull-ups and chin-ups</li>
          <li>Push-ups and dips</li>
          <li>Squats and lunges</li>
          <li>Planks, leg raises, and core holds</li>
          <li>Advanced skills such as muscle-ups, handstands, and levers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unlike machine-based or traditional weight training, Calisthenics focuses on relative strength, movement control, joint stability, and mobility, making it one of the best ways to build athletic, functional strength.</p>
