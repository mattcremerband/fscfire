      <h1>WHY FSC?</h1>

        <section className="basis-full">
          <p>
            At FSC we believe in helping others achieve their health
            and fitness goals with broad and varied functional fitness. People
            start strength and conditioning programs for varying reasons and it
            our desire to assist people in achieving those goals, whether
            it&apos;s to get stronger, lose weight, improve fitness or skill for a
            chosen sport. It may even be simply to meet people and embrace another
            social environment.

            At FSC we provide personal training in a group setting. You
            will receive shared attention with 1-16 other members. This means that
            you can have a personal trainer at a price you can afford with some
            independence. Expect constant attention from your coach during skill
            and strength training and an extra push during your workout. In
            addition, you will receive information and education on mobility and
            nutrition.

            Why Does Functional Fitness Work?
          </Text>
          <p>
            Functional fitness is effective because our approach to fitness
            promotes and cultivates a well-rounded and all-encompassing form of
            physical wellness. Our emphasis is on avoiding specialization. Our
            firsthand experience as coaches has shown that more frequent, brief,
            diverse, and high-intensity training sessions lead to superior
            outcomes. Instructors frequently introduce variations in weight,
            distance, and pace in each workout, incorporating both aerobic and
            anaerobic exercises. Occasionally, workouts prioritize strength,
            speed, or endurance individually, while at other times, they
            incorporate a blend of these elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the emphasis on a wide range of abilities, individuals who
            engage in our program experience substantial enhancements in their
            physique, overall physical capability, and health metrics (such as
            blood pressure and cholesterol). Their proficiency in sports and
            everyday activities also noticeably improves. When our approach to
            functional fitness is consistently adopted, achievements and positive
            outcomes are assured!

            Our Classes
          </Text>
          <p>
            In our one-hour group sessions, members will be led by our coaches
            through multiple phases of exercise and recovery:
          </p>
          <strong>A general warm up to prepare the body for exercise</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mobility drills to improve and restore joint mobility and function
            </li>
            <li>
              Skill or strength based session to improve technique, power or speed
            </li>
            <li>
              The Workout of the Day (WOD) - which will be any combination of body
              weight movements, running, rowing, lifting and even gymnastics and
              Olympic weightlifting. Performed at varying degrees of intensity.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="basis-full">
          <p>
            In a typical WOD, we perform functional movements at a high intensity,
            giving you a comprehensive full-body workout. Each day is a different
            workout which will be constantly varied. The WOD can last anywhere
            from 5 minutes to 30 minutes on average, utilising a variety of
            movements and skills. Workouts usually involve completing a set amount
            of work as quick as possible, or, achieving as many rounds/repetitions
            as possible in a given time.

            FSC aims to hold regular events, seminars, workshops and
            social activities so as to grow the FSC Family, as well
            improve your knowledge and skills. Our community also extends beyond
            the walls of the box to other similarly focussed boxes in Durban as
            well as the rest of South Africa.

          <p>
            Expect your fitness level to change when you start at FSC.
            Individuals will notice improvement in their skills. A runner might
            improve on strength, where as a lifter might improve on their stamina.
            And those who come in &apos;deconditioned&apos; may find that after
            only a few weeks they can do a push-up, pull-up or lift a barbell even
            if they&apos;ve never done so before in their lives.
