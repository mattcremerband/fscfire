            No matter your fitness level or background, all that is absolutely
            necessary to start training is an open mind and a commitment to the
            program.

            You&apos;ve already taken some time to read about who we are.
            We&apos;ve explained how the Functional Fitness can produce remarkable
            results and is scalable to suit all fitness levels and ages. Maybe
            you&apos;re just not sure you believe it, or not sure you will
            &apos;fit in&apos; once you get to our gym. That&apos;s perfectly
            understandable, and you are not the only one who has felt that way.

            Come by and join us for the FREE Intro Class, nothing we say will make
            much sense until you do it. If you don&apos;t like it, all it cost you
            is 60 minutes of your time and at the very least, you will get a great
            workout. However, if you don&apos;t try it, you could be missing an
            opportunity that could be life changing.

            On Ramp
          </Text>
          <p>
            The emphasis of our On-Ramp is skill technique & development, and
            exposure to the basic movements we employ in our training, while
            having fun at the same time! You will learn how to perform the
            fundamental functional fitness movements safely and effectively,
            ensuring a seamless transition into the group workouts after
            completing your On-Ramp course.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each On-Ramp class will be arranged at the convenience of you and the
            coach. Each class is an hour long and will expose you to the basics of
            Functional Fitness in a fun and supportive environment. We start a new
            On-Ramp course every month however, we can run additional onramps if
            required to cater for new members.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be a workout at the end of each On-Ramp class. The
            difficulty of these workouts is ultimately in your hands. The degree
            that you push yourself will determine how tough it will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to slowly ramp you up to the level of intensity and output
            that is inherent in our Functional Fitness group classes, but remember
            focus on technique and mechanics comes first always.
